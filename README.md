# Tune_manipulator_using_VHDL
## Overview
The system was implemented on a Xilinx FPGA using the Vivado Design Suite and the Zybo board. In this program, we use the Audio Codec in the Zybo board to generate 3 unique 8 note tunes. Each of the notes in each tune can be manipulated using the button on the Zybo board to create a new tune.
